# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `GLOSSARY.md` at the repo root.
- `docs/adr/`: read ADRs that touch the area you are about to work in.

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently without flagging their absence. The domain modeling skills create them as decisions and terms get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```text
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-workflow-pipeline-architecture.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
